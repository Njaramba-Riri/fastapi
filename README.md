# FastAPI
- FastAPI is a modern, fast, and high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and to allow for rapid development without sacrificing performance or scalability. With its combination of modern Python features and advanced web framework capabilities, FastAPI has quickly gained popularity in the Python community as one of the most efficient and powerful web frameworks available.

- One of the key features of FastAPI is its use of asynchronous programming, which allows it to handle high-traffic APIs with ease. This is done through the use of the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) standard, which provides an efficient way to handle requests and responses asynchronously. This makes it possible to build high-performance APIs that can handle large amounts of traffic without becoming overwhelmed.

- FastAPI also includes a powerful data validation system that uses Python type annotations to automatically generate JSON Schemas for API requests and responses. This means that developers can easily create APIs with strongly-typed input and output parameters, which makes it easier to catch bugs and maintain code quality over time.

- Another feature that sets FastAPI apart from other Python web frameworks is its automatic API documentation generation. FastAPI uses the OpenAPI standard to automatically generate interactive API documentation based on the code itself. This means that developers can easily create and maintain API documentation without any additional effort.

- FastAPI also includes a built-in dependency injection system, which makes it easy to inject and manage dependencies in a modular and reusable way. This allows developers to create clean and maintainable code that is easy to test and debug.
